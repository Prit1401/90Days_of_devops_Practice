Q . What is the linux command to

1) Check your present working directory.
Ans : We can use the "PWD" command for check the present working directory .

2) List all the files or directories including hidden files.
Ans : we can use "ls -a" command to display all files .
      ls : list the contents of a directory
      -a : includes all hidden files (files or directories starting with dot .)

3) Create a nested directory A/B/C/D/E
Ans : we can use " mkdir -p A/B/C/D/E " for nested directory.
      mkdir : creates directories
      -p :  - it is use to creates parent directories as needed. if any of the directories in the path (like A, B, C..) dont exist , it creates them .
            - if any of the directories already exist , it just skips over them without showing any error.
             it means you dont have to worry to create manually creating each directory step bye step or checking if thy alredy exist.
